# HW-4-Coding-Quiz

## Description

I was asked to use the following list of acceptance criteria to create a quiz and satisfactorily resolve a user story:
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz 
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
Our instructor and TAs detailed we could make the content of the quiz anything we'd like, so I chose to make a trivia quiz about one of my favorite games, Subnautica.

I wrote all code from scratch using my prior knowledge from my class's content, with minimal assistance from googled articles. The javascript dynamically creates list items using a library of questions and answers, and uses the event delegation method to make them mimic buttons so the user can submit answers. After the quiz is over, the application can store high scores in local storage, display them, and clear them if desired.

A gif was provided to us to demonstrate proper functionality; I tried to mimic the functions in that gif as closely as possible while adding my own style.

## Credits
I used some of the tips from this article to assist me with storing high scores: https://michael-karen.medium.com/how-to-save-high-scores-in-local-storage-7860baca9d68.

I used this site to decided on a gradient for my header. I may change it later: https://cssgradient.io/gradient-backgrounds/

As always, I used this site to help determine the colors I used: https://coolors.co/b74f6f-1f0322-f7dba7-4a6c6f-d5c6e0.
